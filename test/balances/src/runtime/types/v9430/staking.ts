/**
 * (Re-)sets the controller of a stash to the stash itself. This function previously
 * accepted a `controller` argument to set the controller to an account other than the
 * stash itself. This functionality has now been removed, now only setting the controller
 * to the stash, if it is not already.
 * 
 * Effects will be felt instantly (as soon as this function is completed successfully).
 * 
 * The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_ by the stash, not the controller.
 * 
 * ## Complexity
 * O(1)
 * - Independent of the arguments. Insignificant complexity.
 * - Contains a limited number of reads.
 * - Writes are limited to the `origin` account key.
