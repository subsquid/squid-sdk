/**
 *  Register approval for a dispatch to be made from a deterministic composite account if
 *  approved by a total of `threshold - 1` of `other_signatories`.
 * 
 *  If there are enough, then dispatch the call. Calls must each fulfil the `IsCallable`
 *  filter.
 * 
 *  Payment: `DepositBase` will be reserved if this is the first approval, plus
 *  `threshold` times `DepositFactor`. It is returned once this dispatch happens or
 *  is cancelled.
 * 
 *  The dispatch origin for this call must be _Signed_.
 * 
 *  - `threshold`: The total number of approvals for this dispatch before it is executed.
 *  - `other_signatories`: The accounts (other than the sender) who can approve this
 *  dispatch. May not be empty.
 *  - `maybe_timepoint`: If this is the first approval, then this must be `None`. If it is
 *  not the first approval, then it must be `Some`, with the timepoint (block number and
 *  transaction index) of the first approval transaction.
 *  - `call`: The call to be executed.
 * 
 *  NOTE: Unless this is the final approval, you will generally want to use
 *  `approve_as_multi` instead, since it only requires a hash of the call.
 * 
 *  Result is equivalent to the dispatched result if `threshold` is exactly `1`. Otherwise
 *  on success, result is `Ok` and the result from the interior call, if it was executed,
 *  may be found in the deposited `MultisigExecuted` event.
 * 
 *  # <weight>
 *  - `O(S + Z + Call)`.
 *  - Up to one balance-reserve or unreserve operation.
 *  - One passthrough operation, one insert, both `O(S)` where `S` is the number of
 *    signatories. `S` is capped by `MaxSignatories`, with weight being proportional.
 *  - One call encode & hash, both of complexity `O(Z)` where `Z` is tx-len.
 *  - One encode & hash, both of complexity `O(S)`.
 *  - Up to one binary search and insert (`O(logS + S)`).
 *  - I/O: 1 read `O(S)`, up to 1 mutate `O(S)`. Up to one remove.
 *  - One event.
 *  - The weight of the `call`.
 *  - Storage: inserts one item, value size bounded by `MaxSignatories`, with a
 *    deposit taken for its lifetime of
 *    `DepositBase + threshold * DepositFactor`.
