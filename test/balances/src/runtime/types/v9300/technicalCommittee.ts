 * Add a new proposal to either be voted on or executed directly.

 * or put up for voting.
 * 
 * # <weight>
 * ## Weight
 * - `O(B + M + P1)` or `O(B + M + P2)` where:
 *   - `B` is `proposal` size in bytes (length-fee-bounded)
 *   - `M` is members-count (code- and governance-bounded)
 *   - branching is influenced by `threshold` where:
 *     - `P1` is proposal execution complexity (`threshold < 2`)
 *     - `P2` is proposals-count (code-bounded) (`threshold >= 2`)
 * - DB:
 *   - 1 storage read `is_member` (codec `O(M)`)
 *   - 1 storage read `ProposalOf::contains_key` (codec `O(1)`)
 *   - DB accesses influenced by `threshold`:
 *     - EITHER storage accesses done by `proposal` (`threshold < 2`)
 *     - OR proposal insertion (`threshold <= 2`)
 *       - 1 storage mutation `Proposals` (codec `O(P2)`)
 *       - 1 storage mutation `ProposalCount` (codec `O(1)`)
 *       - 1 storage write `ProposalOf` (codec `O(B)`)
 *       - 1 storage write `Voting` (codec `O(M)`)
 *   - 1 event
