# Subsquid - an ETL framework for Web3 data

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) framework is a set of tools to ingest, transform and present blockchain data.

Our current focus is on [substrate](https://substrate.io)-based chains,
with support for EVM-based chains coming next.

## Overview

Subsquid framework consists of several key components.

### Archive

An Archive is a set of services formed by [substrate-ingest](substrate-ingest),
[substrate-gateway](https://github.com/subsquid/substrate-gateway), postgres compatible database
and optionally [substrate-explorer](substrate-explorer), which together

1. ingest blockchain data
2. decode and persist it in a normalized form
3. make it available for further processing and exploration.

Compared to data access using a conventional chain node RPC, an archive allows one to access data in a more granular fashion and from multiple blocks at once. The explorer service provides a GraphQL API for querying historical blocks, events and transactions with rich filtering capabilities. 

### Processor

[substrate-processor](substrate-processor) fetches on-chain data from an archive and executes
user-defined mapping code against it.

### Typegen tools

[substrate-typegen(1)](substrate-typegen) can generate facade TypeScript classes
for substrate events, calls and storage items, allowing to work with chain data
in a fully typesafe and runtime upgrades aware fashion.

Similarly, [squid-evm-typegen(1)](evm-typegen) generates facade TypeScript classes for type-safe processing of EVM logs.  

### Postgres

`substrate-processor` is designed to be able to load the processed data into an arbitrary database and indeed one can run it without a persistent store. 

However, extra tooling for data modeling and serving the data with GraphQL is available when a processor is run against a postgres-compatible database. In such a case, the Subsquid framework suggests the following dev flow:

1. Define the target database schema using a GraphQL dialect enriched with custom directives
2. Generate [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) entity classes with [typeorm-codegen](typeorm-codegen)
3. Generate and apply database migrations with [typeorm-migration](typeorm-migration)
4. Use powerful and extensible [GraphQL server](graphql-server) to serve produced data right away.

### Squid

ETL projects built with the Subsquid framework are called _Squids_.

Squids have a certain structure and are supposed to be developed as regular node.js packages. See [squid-template](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template) for a reference. 

A typical squid implements both data mapping and an API server presenting the data.

Squids can be deployed to a Subsquid cloud service called [Aquairum](https://app.subsquid.io). In the future, the cloud service will be replaced by an open network of decentralized squid operators.

For more details on how to build, run and deploy a squid consult the [Docs](https://docs.subsquid.io)


### Other tools

The Subsquid framework incorporates a few npm packages that might be useful in a standalone mode:

* [scale-codec](scale-codec) - encoder and decoder for [SCALE](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) data serialization format
* [ss58-codec](ss58-codec) - encoder and decoder for [SS58 address format](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/ss58/)
* [ss58](ss58) - [ss58-codec](ss58-codec) paired with [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry).
