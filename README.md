# Squid SDK - an ETL framework for Web3 data

The Squid SDK is a set of tools to ingest, transform and present blockchain data.

The SDK currently supports indexing of EVM- and [Substrate](https://substrate.io)-based chains.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to install [squid CLI](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-cli) and scaffold a squid project with [`sqd init`](https://docs.subsquid.io/squid-cli/init/). 

For step-by-step instructions, follow one of the [Quickstart guides](https://docs.subsquid.io/quickstart/).

## Overview

The Squid SDK consists of several key components.

### Processor

[`substrate-processor`](substrate/substrate-processor) (for Substrate-based networks) and [`evm-processor`](https://github.com/subsquid/evm-processor)(for EVM networks) fetch on-chain data from an Archive and execute user-defined data mapping code to transform and persist the data into the target database.

### Typegen tools

[squid-substrate-typegen(1)](substrate/substrate-typegen) generates facade TypeScript classes
for type-safe decoding substrate events, calls and RPC storage queires. It natively supports Substrate runtime upgrades by inspecting the historical metadata changes and generating runtime version-aware data access methods. 

Similarly, [squid-evm-typegen(1)](evm/evm-typegen) generates facade TypeScript classes for type-safe decoding of EVM event logs, transaction data and RPC contract state responses.  

### Postgres

Both `evm-processor` and `substrate-processor` are designed to be able to load the processed data into an arbitrary database and indeed one can run it without a persistent store. 

Extra tooling for data modeling and serving the data with GraphQL is available when a processor is run against a postgres-compatible database. In such a case, the Subsquid framework suggests the following dev flow:

1. Define the target database schema using a GraphQL dialect enriched with custom directives
2. Generate [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io) entity classes with [typeorm-codegen](typeorm/typeorm-codegen)
3. Generate and apply database migrations with [typeorm-migration](typeorm/typeorm-migration)
4. Use powerful and extensible [GraphQL server](graphql/graphql-server) to serve the produced data.

See the [docs](https://docs.subsquid.io) for more details on the data modelling using the schema file and an auto-generated GraphQL API over it.

### Other tools

The Subsquid framework incorporates a few npm packages that might be useful in a standalone mode:

* [commands](util/commands) - a cross-platform runner of project-specific commands. Designed to replace `Makefile` and `package.json` scripts for squid projects. Natively integrated in [squid CLI](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-cli).
* [scale-codec](substrate/scale-codec) - encoder and decoder for [SCALE](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) data serialization format
* [ss58-codec](substrate/ss58-codec) - encoder and decoder for [SS58 address format](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/ss58/)
* [ss58](substrate/ss58) - [ss58-codec](substrate/ss58-codec) paired with [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry).

## Archives

An Archive is a specilized data lake optimized for batch access to the historical event and transaction data. Archives are the primary data sources for squid projects developed with the Squid SDK. Currently, public Archives are maintained by the Subsquid Labs GmbH and will be replaced by a decentralized solution in the future.

- For EVM chains, see a [separate `eth-archive` repo](https://github.com/subsquid/eth-archive). For a list of public EVM archive endpoints, see the 
[docs](https://docs.subsquid.io/develop-a-squid/evm-processor/configuration/).

- For Substrate chains, the achive service is formed by [`substrate-ingest`](substrate/substrate-ingest),
[`substrate-gateway`](https://github.com/subsquid/substrate-gateway), postgres compatible database
and optionally [`substrate-explorer`](substrate/substrate-explorer), which together

1. ingest blockchain data
2. decode and persist it in a normalized form
3. make it available for further processing and exploration.

For a list of public Substrate acrhives, see [the Aquarium page](https://app.subsquid.io/archives).

Compared to data access using a conventional chain node RPC, an archive allows one to access data in a more granular fashion and from multiple blocks at once.
